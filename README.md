This project is an attempt to create my own website to sell my Jewelry. 
For years now, I've been selling my jewelry on Etsy but my account was suspended due to Etsy's change of policy where they decided to stop using PayPal as the payment method.
So, I thought about creating my own website using ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework Core.
The database is called SelkaWraps. It's a SQL Server database.

I hope you enjoy this journey and maybe some day, you can use this project to sell your own items.
Thank you.
